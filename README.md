# ingress dns

This code looks for ingress controllers and then adds an entry to a consul server so that the ingress point has a DNS entry.

Define a replication controller for ingress DNS

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: router
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    name: router
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: router
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ingressdns
        image: zekizeki/ingressdns:0.0.1
        env:
          - name: KUBE_API_URL
            value: "http://kubernetes"
          - name: DOMAIN
            value: service.consul
          - name: CONSUL_API_ADDRESS
            value: http://localhost:8500/v1/agent/service/register
```

# Create the ingressdns rc

```
kubectl create -f ingressdns.yaml
```


The host name used in an ingress must be made up of 4 portions and end in service.consul (unless consul has been configured to use a different domain label)

e.g.    myservice.myenv.service.consul
